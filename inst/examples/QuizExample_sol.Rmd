# Problemset Quizzes

Example of different quiz formats in a shiny based RTutor problemset

Run the setup chunk in RStudio. This creates the problem set files and the sample solution from this solution file. 

#< ignore
```{r "create_ps",include=TRUE , eval=TRUE}
library(RTutor)
set.wd.current()
ps.name = "QuizExample"; sol.file = paste0(ps.name,"_sol.Rmd")
libs = c()

# Important to add the parameter addons="quiz" !
create.ps(sol.file=sol.file, ps.name=ps.name,libs=libs, addons="quiz")
show.ps(ps.name)
stop()
```
#>

<!-- The following code block overwrites the shiny defaults and allows for wider quizzes. You can set to a lower value than 100% if you want to -->
<style>
.shiny-input-radiogroup {
  width: 100% !important;
}
.shiny-input-checkboxgroup {
 width: 100% !important;
}
</style>
<!-- End optional code block for wide quizzes -->


## Exercise Quizexamples

### A single choice quiz

A single choice quiz has the identifier *sc*. The star defines the correct answer.

#< quiz "single"
question: 1. What is 20*20?
sc:
    - 100
    - 200
    - 400*
    - 500
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.
choice_commentary{1}: 100? That is awfully low.
#>

### A single choice quiz which is long

In the default setting quizzes are optimized for short one-word answers. Using a longer paragraph however introduces a linebreak. Using the css styles at the top of this file (directly above *Exercise Quizexamples*) it is possible to set the quiz width to the same width as the rest of the problem set.

Additionally we see in this example, that the name of the quiz (here: *longsingle*) has no bearing on the type of quiz, but should be unique. 

#< quiz "longsingle"
question: 2. What is the longest name of a settlement?
sc:
    - Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu
    - Llanfairpwllgwyngyll*

success: Yes indeed. This a village in Wales, United Kingdom.
failure: No. This is a hill in New Zealand.

### A single choice quiz with RMD and HTML

It is possible to include RMD or HTML into the quiz, allowing for mathematical questions using latex syntax, syntax highlighting outside of RMD and non-ASCII characters. Note that an exception is made for the automatic numbering of RMD. Writing "3." as has been done here therefore does not translate to the automatic labeling of RMD which would default to 1. Instead the actually written number is displayed. 

#< quiz "rmdhtml"
question: 3. What is the formula for the <span style="color: red;">**geometric series**</span>. Assume $q \in \mathbb{R}$ but $|q| < 1$?
sc:
    - This: $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$
    - Or <span style="color: green;">that</span>: $\sum \limits_{k=0}^\infty a_0 q^k = \frac{a_0}{1-q}$*
    - !2b|2b?

success: Yay. You are quite educated. &#x1F600;
failure: No, unfortunately not. &#x1F615;
#>
<br>
Note that even though the quizzes work with yaml which seperates fields using a <code>:</code> character, RTutor allows for answers using <code>:</code>. This is especially useful in the context of HTML commands. Other yaml commands are also disabled, which makes it possible to have the quiz above with a starting <code>!</code>. To show this the third option is purposefully not in Math Mode.

HTML commands in particular allow to use images as answers:
<br>

#< quiz "images"
question: 4. Only one of those buildings has the highest church tower of the world (as of 2020). Which one?
sc:
    - <img src="images/luis-fernando-felipe-alves-free-image-unsplash.jpg" />*
    - <img src="images/peter-gonzalez-free-image-unsplash.jpg" />

success: Exactly! The Ulm Minster measures a height of 161.5 metres. 
failure: Thats wrong. This is the Cologne Cathedral, only measuring a measly 157 metres.

### A multiple choice quiz with commentary

A multiple choice quiz has the identifier *mc*. While also working with *single choice* quizzes, here the *choice commentary* system allows its full power:

Using the optional `choice_commentary` command a failure results not only in the failure message but also additionally in the provided commentary. To allow for a maximum of  flexibility to the author of the problem set these `choice_commentary` commands take arbitrary expressions to define their trigger. These expressions are hidden to the user to allow for vague hints. There are two ways to define the trigger:

1. **Full expression:** Check whether the chosen set of answers corresponds to a condition using `chosen` as the key variable for the chosen answers. Examples for particulary useful commands are:
  * choice_commentary{any(c(1,2,6) %in% chosen)}: Text
      + Displays *Text* if answer 1, 2, 6 or any combination thereof has been chosen, independent on other choices.
  * choice_commentary{all(c(1,2,6) %in% chosen)}: Text
      + Displays *Text* if 1, 2 and 6 have been chosen. This is only sensible in the case of a multiple choice quiz.
  * choice_commentary{all(chosen %in% c(1:3,6))}: Text
      + Display *Text* if nothing other than 1, 2, 3 or 6 has been chosen.
2. **Shorthand:** Display a message as soon as a specific answer is (not) chosen, independent on other answers (as long as the solution is not correct).
  * choice_commentary{6}: Text
      + Displays *Text* if answer is chosen.
      + Is identical to *choice_commentary{c(6) %in% chosen}: Text*
  * choice_commentary{!4}: Text
      + Displays *Text* if answer is not chosen.
      + Is identical to *choice_commentary{!(c(4) %in% chosen)}: Text*
      
Commentaries are always displayed in the order as provided by the quiz. 

Try answer *4*, *8*, both,  or the first 4 possiblities to see different commentaries.

#< quiz "multi"
question: Check all prime numbers
mc:
    - 2*
    - 3*
    - 4
    - 5*
    - 6
    - 7*
    - 8
success: Great, all answers are correct!
failure: Not all answers correct. Try again.
choice_commentary{3}: It holds that $4=2 \cdot 2$, so answering 4 is wrong.
choice_commentary{7}: The number 8 is, like, the most non-prime number you could pick.
choice_commentary{!4}: Not selecting 5 is understandable but wrong. All numbers (with the exception of 5 itself!) ending in 5 are indeed not prime.
choice_commentary{all(1:4 %in% chosen) && !any(5:7 %in% chosen)}: The density of prime numbers is indeed higher with lower numbers, but not all low numbers are prime and vice versa: By conclusion this is a wrong answer.
choice_commentary{any(c(3,5,7) %in% chosen)}: The number 2 is the only even number which is prime. In a way this makes 2 the oddest prime. &#x1F602;

### An open question

#< quiz "music"
question: Johann ???? Bach
answer: Sebastian
#>

### An open question with a numeric answer

#< quiz "pi"
question: State $\pi$ up to 2 digits. You have to be correct within $\pm 0.01$.
answer: 3.14
roundto: 0.01
#>


### A quiz consisting of several questions (and a single check button)

All other features (choice commentary, HTML etc.) apply as well, despite the different syntax.

#< quiz "parts"
parts:
  - question: 1. What is 20*20?
    choices:
        - 100
        - 200
        - 400*
        - 500
    multiple: FALSE
    success: Great, your answer is correct!
    failure: Try again.
    choice_commentary{4}: How?
  - question: 2. State $\pi$ up to 2 digits. You have to be correct within $\pm 0.01$.
    answer: 3.14
    roundto: 0.01
