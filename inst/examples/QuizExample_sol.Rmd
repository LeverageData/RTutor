# Problemset Quizzes

Example of different quiz formats in a shiny based RTutor problemset

Run the setup chunk in RStudio. This creates the problem set files and the sample solution from this solution file. 

#< ignore
```{r "create_ps",include=TRUE , eval=TRUE}
library(RTutor)
setwd(get.current.file.path()) #Has to be executed using RStudio. Replace with specific string to work with console or RGui
ps.name = "QuizExample"; sol.file = paste0(ps.name,"_sol.Rmd")
libs = c()

# Important to add the parameter addons="quiz" !
create.ps(sol.file=sol.file, ps.name=ps.name,libs=libs, addons="quiz")
show.ps(ps.name)
stop()
```

<!-- The following code block overwrites the shiny defaults and allows for wider quizzes. You can set to a lower value than 100% if you want to -->
<style>
.shiny-input-radiogroup {
  width: 100% !important;
}
.shiny-input-checkboxgroup {
 width: 100% !important;
}
</style>
<!-- End optional code block for wide quizzes -->


## Exercise Quizexamples

### A single choice quiz

A single choice quiz has the identifier *sc*. The star defines the correct answer.

#< quiz "single"
question: What is 20*20?
sc:
    - 100
    - 200
    - 400*
    - 500
success: Great, your answer is correct!
failure: Try again.
#>

### A single choice quiz which is long

In the default setting quizzes are optimized for short one-word answers. Using a longer paragraph however introduces a linebreak. Using the css styles at the top of this file (directly above *Exercise Quizexamples*) it is possible to set the quiz width to the same width as the rest of the problem set.

Additionally we see in this example, that the name of the quiz (here: *longsingle*) has no bearing on the type of quiz, but should be unique. 

#< quiz "longsingle"
question: What is the longest name of a settlement?
sc:
    - Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu
    - Llanfairpwllgwyngyll*

success: Yes indeed. This a village in Wales, United Kingdom.
failure: No. This is a hill in New Zealand.
#>

### A single choice quiz with RMD and HTML

It is possible to include RMD or HTML into the quiz, allowing for mathematical questions using latex syntax, syntax highlighting outside of RMD and non-ASCII characters. Even though the quizzes work with yaml which seperates fields using a <code>:</code> character, RTutor allows for answers using <code>:</code>. This is especially useful in the context of HTML commands.
#< quiz "rmdhtml"
question: What is the formula for the <span style="color: red;">**geometric series**</span>. Assume $q \in \mathbb{R}$ but $|q| < 1$?
sc:
    - This: $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$
    - Or <span style="color: green;">that</span>: $\sum \limits_{k=0}^\infty a_0 q^k = \frac{a_0}{1-q}$*

success: Yay. You are quite educated. &#x1F600;
failure: No, unfortunately not. &#x1F615;

This allows it also to use images as answers:

#< quiz "images"
question: Only one of those buildings has the highest church tower of the world (as of 2020). Which one?
sc:
    - <img src="images/luis-fernando-felipe-alves-free-image-unsplash.jpg" />*
    - <img src="images/peter-gonzalez-free-image-unsplash.jpg" />

success: Exactly! The Ulm Minster measures a height of 161.5 metres. 
failure: Thats wrong. This is the Cologne Cathedral, only measuring a measily 157 metres.

### A multiple choice quiz

A multiple choice quiz has the identifier *mc*.

#< quiz "multi"
question: Check all prime numbers
mc:
    - 2*
    - 3*
    - 4
    - 5*
    - 6
    - 7*
    - 8
success: Great, all answers are correct!
failure: Not all answers correct. Try again.

### An open question

#< quiz "music"
question: Johann ???? Bach
answer: Sebastian
#>

### An open question with a numeric answer

#< quiz "pi"
question: 2. State pi up to 2 digits
answer: 3.14
roundto: 0.01
#>


### A quiz consisting of several questions (and a single check button)

#< quiz "parts"
parts:
  - question: 1. What is 20*20?
    choices:
        - 100
        - 200
        - 400*
        - 500
    multiple: FALSE
    success: Great, your answer is correct!
    failure: Try again.
  - question: 2. State pi up to 2 digits
    answer: 3.14
    roundto: 0.01
